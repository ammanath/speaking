Motivators : 
Frederick Herzbergi asserts that the powerful motivator in our lives isn't money; its the opportunity to learn, grown in responsiblities, contribute to others and be recognized for achievements. 

Managers impact:
In my minds' eye I see one of my directs leave for work one morning with a relatively strong level of self-esteen. Then I pictured her driving home to her family 10 hours later, feeling unappreciated, frustrated, underutilized and demeaned. I imagined how profoundly her lowered self-esteen affected the way she interacted with her children. The vision in my mind then fast-forwarded to another day, when she drove home with greater self-esteem - feeling that she had learned a lot, been recognized for achieving valuable things, and played a significant role in the success of some important initiatives. I then imagined how positively that affected her as a spocuse and a parent. My conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if its practiced well. No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsiblity and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team.
